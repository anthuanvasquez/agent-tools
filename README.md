# Agent Tools

Repository to hold standardized guidance, agent rules, and scaffold templates for applying AI agents (Copilot, Claude, Google) safely and productively in engineering workflows.

This repo currently provides:
- `AGENTS.md` — rules for agent behavior
- `.github/copilot-instructions.md` — Copilot-specific instructions

## Quick Start

Initialize a new project with the agents configuration using the following command:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anthuanvasquez/agents-tools/main/install.sh | bash
```

This will prompt you for a project name and configure **GitHub Copilot**, **Claude Code**, and **Google Antigravity** automatically.
