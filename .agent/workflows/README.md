# Google Antigravity — Workflows

Example workflows to run Antigravity analyses and produce actionable output.

- `dependency-audit.yml` — describes steps to run a dependency scan, gather license data, and produce a PR with a remediation plan.
- `standards-scan.yml` — steps to verify conformance to a standard (e.g., OpenAPI, RFC) with links to evidence.

Store reproducible commands and any tool versions in `.agent/workflows/` files.
