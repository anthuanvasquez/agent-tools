# Design & UX Guidelines

## Design Philosophy
**"Wow the User"**: Every interface should feel premium, responsive, and alive.

- **Aesthetics**:
  - Avoid generic colors (plain red, blue, green).
  - Use curated HSL palettes (e.g., specific shades like `#3b82f6` instead of `blue`).
  - Implement sleek dark modes and glassmorphism where appropriate.
- **Typography**:
  - Use modern sans-serif fonts (Inter, Roboto, Outfit).
  - Ensure proper hierarchy (H1 -> H6).

## Interactive Elements
- **Micro-animations**: meaningful transitions for hover, click, and loading states.
- **Feedback**: Immediate visual feedback for all user actions (buttons, inputs).
- **Responsive**: Mobile-first design that scales elegantly to desktop.

## Components
- Do not use placeholders.
- If an image is needed, use generative tools to create a mockup or working demonstration.
